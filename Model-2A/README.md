In Model 2A, the goal is to calculate the number of fire incidents per 1000 people.  
The **input** are the data sets described below, and the **output** is a map which indicates the tracts with the highest number of incidents per 1000 people.

Data required to successfully run Model 2A:

- **_formatted_addresses.csv*: files that contain the formatted addresses of buildings for each year
- **_geocoded_addresses.csv*: files that contain the geocoded addresses of buildings for each year
- *basicincident.txt*: file contains information about any incidents reported by fire department, not necessarily involving a fire
- *national_county.txt*: file contains national and state FIPS codes (a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code) for counties and county equivalent entities.  
- *NFIRS_FireIncidents.csv*: file contains information about the incidents reported by fire departments to NFIRS that did involve a fire
- *Tract_2010Census_DP1.dbf*: 2010 census tract data 
- *us2010trf.txt*: 2010 tract relationship file from census

The data files are too large for this repo, so they are stored on the Google Drive: ??

Folders and files from Phase 1 are labeled as phase1-* so that others may view the work the Originals completed.  
Folders and files from Phase 2 are labeled as phase2-* so that others may view the work in progress by the Phase 2 team.
