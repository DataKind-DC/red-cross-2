## Background of Phase 1

Where should the American Red Cross go to install smoke alarms?
=======
The first step of the Red Cross Phase 2 is to replicate and document well Phase 1 results. There are size models that the team is working to replicate, if you are interested in helping out on one, the Data Corps contact person is below.

In 2015, DataKind DC, the American Red Cross, and Enigma worked together to create a Home-Fire Risk Score at the U.S. Census Tract Level. The team created models to predict the highest impact areas to go knock on doors to install smoke alarms. These models were developed using proprietary data from the American Red Cross, the American Community Survey, the American Housing Survey, and NFIRS. Since the Red Cross doesn't visit all areas of the USA, risk scores were imputed to non-surveyed areas. Results were displayed on the smoke signals map. Some work was also done to understand historical home fires, where did it happen, how deadly were they?

## How to Help in Phase 2

The first step of the Red Cross Phase 2 is to replicate and document well Phase 1 results. Phase 1's original GitHub repo is <a href link="https://github.com/DataKind-DC/smoke_alarm_models">here</a>. There are six models that the team is working to replicate, if you are interested in helping out on one, the Data Corps contact person is below.

The 2015 Risk Score is a simple average of 5 risks scores from 5 independent models. Full notes are here. Six models were developed using various data sources and available at various geographic levels of aggregation.
